				<p>Kasilam is a Xhosa term or slang that translates to "my home, my township." The purpose of Kasilam cricket is to get 
				every child, boy and girl, playing cricket. We at Kasilam cricket believe that no adult can teach a child how to play. Therefore, we want
				to create an environment where kids are free to play the cricket where they are. Be it in the street, at home, in front of the garage, at 
				the park. Kasilam cricket wants to get as many South African kids playing the game where they are.</p>
				
				<h2 id= "Kasilam-pathway">Kasilam Pathway</h2>
				<p>Kasilam cricket has a clear pathway for kids, boys and girls, from the age of five all the way to senior cricket. For this program to work 
				we will need the involvement of parents, schools, teachers, communities and cricket clubs. The program uses street cricket to introduce the
				boys and girls to the game of cricket and then provides a formal program for boys and girls from the age of 9 years old all the way to 19 years of age.
				Kids will then filter into cricket clubs within their communities to provide a strong pathway and provision of players.</p>
